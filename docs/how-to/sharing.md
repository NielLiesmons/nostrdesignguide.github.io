# Sharing

Sharing outside of nostr makes nostr grow faster. I didn't mean to rhyme, but it's true. 

So, let's build in some sharing features to help people share their content and media outside of nostr!

## Sharing on Nostr

Some clients already do a great job with content discovery by surfacing different types of notes. Amethyst and Snort automatically show recent streams started via ZapStream.

Unless your goal is to build a single-task client that does one thing well, interoperable content such as streams, chats and communities can be a great way to promote discovery within nostr.

### Broadcasting from client to client

Sharing on nostr can also happen via direct action such as pressing a button to broadcast a note to nostr relays.

### Client UI Considerations

#### If it's hidden, it doesn't exist

## Nostr Button

## Open Graph Data
