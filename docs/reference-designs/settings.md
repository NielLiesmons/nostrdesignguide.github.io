# Settings

The settings screen can vary quite a bit depending on the type of client, platform and what sorts of features the client implements. Below you will find various settings examples. Please check back often to see updated reference designs. 

Use these designs to help you get an idea of how to display settings, or as starting points for further customization and styling. If you'd like help with your open source project, please don't hesitate to tag `#nostrdesign `in nostr or reach out to the Open Stats designers.
