## Exploring by Relay Sets
The following is a hypothetical user experience for browsing multiple topic-based relays as part of a "relay set". The idea is to fetch content that falls under grouped categories but can live on various relays around the world.
**Pictured UX:**
- User automatically joins the relay when they click on it
- When the user visits another “category” aka relay, they leave the last one
- When the user visits “all” relays, they join all automatically

## Relay Set Modal
**Pictured UX**
- Clicking on the relay icons next to each relay set will display them in a modal
- Users can join or leave relay by relay or in bulk
- Users can search for other relays (search is optional)
