On mobile, we would just shrink the width.

## Simple Search
Basic search for hashtags and usernames. Entering text will return results for notes containing that word. An advanced version of the simple search could return `Topics`.

## Returned Results wth Filtering In-Content
In this example, a person has searched for "fi". We can present results from a variety of categories such as `Profiles`, `Notes & Replies`, `Hashtags` etc...
